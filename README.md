### Hello there 👋
Welcome to my personal github page! 

Here I'm uploading some projects I have done during my engineering graduation (I'm still undergraduate and hope to remove this parentheses in the nexts commits) and also personal projects made on my particular studies.

- 🔭 I'm curretly working with Android developing as intern.

- 🌱 I'm studying about architectures (like MVVM, MVI) to use in Android projects and about new ways to design UIs too (don't you think Material3 is so beautiful?).
