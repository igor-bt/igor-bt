### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal github page! 

Here I'm uploading some projects I have done during my engineering graduation and also personal projects made on my particular studies.

- ðŸ”­ I'm curretly working with Android NAtive development.

- ðŸŒ± I'm studying about architectures (like MVVM, MVI) to use in Android projects and about new ways to design UIs with Jetpack Compose too (don't you think Material3 is so beautiful?).

- ðŸŒ± I'm interest in accessibility design and development of applications, we have to build things everyone can use!

### Some technologies I already worked with:
